--  Provides the implementation of a simple cache.
--
--  All abstract methods from the Cache class are provided, plus a Connect
--  method to connect a cache to a secondary cache, so that a cache-hierarchy
--  can be built and properly simulated.
--
--  Fixed cache parameters like associativity, length of a cache line and the
--  number of available blocks are provided as discriminants.
--  The private methods Fetch_Line as well as address translation services
--  (Get_Block, To_Address) are declared and defined.
--
--  Assumptions made in the implementation:
--    Cache-line lengths are not expected to decrease with several levels
--    (generally spoken, a block of a lower-order cache should always be
--    contained within a block of the higher-order cache).
--    For instance, if the first level has a 64-byte granularity, and the second
--    level has a 32-byte cache-line, it would always require two (much slower)
--    accesses to load the whole cache-line of the first level. Likewise,
--    flushing a cache-line would require two distinct write operations to the
--    higher-order cache.
--    Doing such stupid thing does not make sense in the real world, so I see no
--    point in supporting it in this crappy simulation. The assumption is made
--    that a read or write access always operates on whole cache-lines
--    throughout the hierarchy.
--
--  Cache behaviour:
--    This simple cache simulates a cache similar to those found in any modern
--    micro-processor, yet there are some noteworthy differences:
--
--    1) The strategy to flush cache-lines is to select a random line from the
--       available slots, most real-world caches employ a least-recently-used
--       strategy. So major differences between the simulated and an actual
--       performance are expected if certain pathological access pattern (like
--       forward/backward runs) are expected.
--       If such pathological cases are to be simulated, it might be better to
--       derive from this class and do a proper implementation for the
--       (protected) method Fetch_Line.
--    2) The size of a memory access is not taken into account.
--       The cache behaves as if a single byte is requested each time.
--       In the real-word, a memory access could span across cache-lines, which
--       is not simulated here. However, it can be simulated by checking if an
--       unaligned (or large) access is attempted and then doing consecutive
--       reads accordingly.
--       This is how most processors handle unaligned accesses and as this is a
--       cache-, not a processor-simulation, you have to do it on your own if
--       you need it.
--
--  Performance Parameters:
--    The speed differences between multiple layers of caches can be influenced
--    by the Speed_Factor parameter in the Connect method.
--    The default is 8.0, as usual access time differences are in the ordner of
--    a magnitude.
--    To accomodate for the longer time when a cache line is loaded or flushed,
--    such an event is multiplied with the number of bytes in the cache-line
--    before adding it to the performance index. This might not be very precise,
--    because such loads are probably more direct (I'd expect that a cache-line
--    load is a single operation between caches), and writes are often buffered.
--    Yet, considering the much slower speed of the higher-order cache connected
--    it is probably still a good approximation. If all else fails, you can
--    still override the Perf_Index method to implement your own weighting of
--    the cache events.
